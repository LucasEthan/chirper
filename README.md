# Chirper
## A modest but awesome Twitter clone

This is a Twitter clone I'm building while studying Ruby on Rails, Ruby, and web development in general. Only the first of many *AWESOME* web applications to come!

### How to build Chirper

1. Clone it
2. Make changes to `database.yml` (like your postgres username and password)
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Install gems with `bundle install --without production`
5. Create the databases with `rails db:create`
6. Run the `rails server`
7. Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser!
8. Run the test suite with `rspec`

### Stuff to do

- [ ] Add more specs!
- [ ] Add Rails-specific `rubocop` cops
- [ ] Run project-wide `rubocop` autoformat
- [ ] Add continuous integration / deployment (tests, `rubocop`, deploy to Heroku)
- [ ] Switch to `HAML` as an alternative to `erb`?

Chirper is a *work in progress* so check back every now and then! :)
